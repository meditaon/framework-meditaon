# Session #5 - Flow

In this session, participants will learn what flow really is and how to achieve it at work.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on emotional intelligence exercises from the previous week. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-flow): flow. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-methods-to-increase-flow): how to maximize flow. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

Keep a notebook where you note all the interesting points from the session. And questions you didn't have an answer for. Use these notes in the follow-up email.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. Which emotions showed up for you most often in meditation? Were you able to use the technique in other situations as well?

Make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection.

As a teacher, make sure everyone is sharing what they feel safe with. Don’t force them to share something about their inner state or the causes of those inner states. We're getting to a  personal level of our training here. We need to tread lightly.

But. Being able to create a safe space where the group feel they can share is powerful. Most of the breakthroughs I’ve seen has come out of a place of deep sincerity.

For some participants, your group sessions will be the closest thing to religion they will experience. Treat it with the proper amount of respect. This is also a good reason for leaving phones and laptops outside: it helps to build a sense of trust.

## 2. Teaching: flow
Most people are aware of the word flow and have a vague association with it.

Flow has three key characteristics:
1. We forget about time.
2. We’re enjoying ourselves.
3. We’re pushing ourselves.

The potential of flow states are immense. We're both enjoying ourselves and performe at our best. A group that maximizes flow would also be maximizing both well-being and productivity. 

So it’s worth spending time on, to say the least.

But how do we actually achieve flow? We need a couple of things in place.
1. The activity needs to be meaningful.
2. The activity needs to be challenging.
3. We need to be undisturbed.

The first two points relate to Purpose and Mastery, which most companies (hopefully!) are working with already. But that third one is trickier.

How often are we able to work undisturbed?

Most of us are used to working in an environment that both digitally and physically promotes distraction. We send a million emails and Slack messages every day, and pull each other from any sense of flow as soon as we need something.

So how do we change this?

## 3. Methods to increase flow
I suggest starting small. Set up one (1) hour everyday where everyone are allowed to work undisturbed. This could mean working from home or a coffee shop or working at the office but not being allowed to be disturbed.

To get rid of distractions, shut of your email client. You can also use apps like Freedom to shut down the internet on your laptop. Or Self-control for specific websites.

When I have a lot of emailing to do, I shut off internet. This helps me to pile them up and write answers. As soon as I’m online again, I send them all.

This might sound simple - too simple - but don’t knock it until you’ve tried it. Remember that previous comparison to dieting? It’s not that hard to know what to do. You just need to … do it.

For every course I’ve done so far, no-one has wanted to go back to a state where they were always disturbed. It even feels weird that you worked like that! Many increase their flow-time to more hours every day.

How does this relate to meditation? Meditation is a way to get rid of your *inner* distractions. Internet is not a problem if you know how to handle it. But some of us don’t.

The group's homework is to schedule one hour every day for flow. No phones, and perhaps even no internet, but most importantly: no physical distractions. Book a conference room.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on flow. Is the group excited about the idea? Is Mastery and Purpose in place or would they need to fix that as well?

Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

Tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer their questions. Or stuff they'd like to ask 1-on-1. 

Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- It’s easier to get into a state of flow when doing something that’s dangerous. Like mountain biking. Ask the participants where in their life they are experiencing flow. It might be video games or gardening for them.
- There’s no need to have a bunch of notifications on your phone. Delete all the apps and email accounts. Add them only if you find that you can’t work without them. This will help you stay in a state of flow.
- Communication will look different after you’ve introduced the flow-hour. If you’re used to disturbing each other as soon as you need something, you need to think more ahead now. What will I need from this person in the coming hours?
- You could also create a hierarchy of communication. Email is perfect for when you need something in a day or two. Slack for when you need something in the coming hour. Bothering someone IRL is allowed only if there is a crisis going on.
