# Session #4 - EQ

In this session participants will learn how to recognize and manage their emotions more efficient.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections the previous weeks meditation practice. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-emotional-intelligence): emotional intelligence. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-method-invite-mara-for-tea): different ways to increase mindfulness. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings and questions from the session and make sure to follow up on them in an email afterwards.

If the group has decided to stay offline during the sessions, remind them to shut off their devices.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. How has your experience of practice mindfulness been? Was it hard? Easy? Nice? Uncomfortable? Was it hard to find the time to do it? Did you notice anything different in stressful situations?

Make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection. A part of this training is to learn how to communicate your own experience of stress. Not everyone is not apt at it from the start. 

Perhaps someone is still struggling to find the time to do any exercises. If you have any more suggestions on how and where they can find the time, give them this. But you could also tell them to let go. Perhaps this period in life is not the best to introduce new techniques an tools. For some, it actually increases stress to not find time for meditation.

It’s OK to agree with the person at this point to lower the expectancy the homework. Just note that the result will be affected by that.

Remember: everyone struggles to find time to meditate. It’s good to share your own experience here.

## 2. Teaching: emotional intelligence
Just like mindfulness, there are many ways to define emotional intelligence. For the purposes of this course, we’re going to have a simple one: the ability to recognize and communicate emotions in yourself and others.

All group dynamics, and thus productivity, is based on emotions. Am I feeling safe? Happy? Frustrated? Sad? Hopeful? All these states have very different outcomes and might cause problems if you don’t know how to manage them.

The easiest way to understand your emotions is to watch them. Our meditation practices is handy at this point. By just sitting down for a couple of minutes everyday and listening to our state of being we will understand ourselves better.

We all have go-to-feelings that come more often to us than others. Someone gets frustrated as soon as a problem in the project shows up. Someone else gets anxious, scared. Someone gets psyched and enthusiastic - a problem is fun to solve.

By watching yourself you know what your go-to-feeling is. It will present itself in your thoughts and emotions during the meditation. As you sit down and just let the mind do what it does best - create fantasy depictions of the future - you will recognize themes.

## 3. Method: invite Mara for tea
During meditation, a myriad of thoughts and feeling will come to you.

The standard way to meet them is with aversion. “Go away, stupid thoughts and feelings. I’m meditating!”

Unfortunately, this doesn’t work most of the time.

Instead, try inviting the feeling for tea. Even if it’s restlessness or anger. Accept the feeling and keep it close. Be with it, just like you are with your breath.

This will create a space for you, which exists between the stimuli (what causes the feeling) and the reaction (caused by the feeling). Instead of shouting at your coworker because they didn’t do as you agreed, you will first recognize your feeling of anger.

“Oh, so this is anger. I’ve seen you before. Hi, anger.”

This space between impulse and reaction is worth a whole lot in a stressful project. Instead of just reacting to what you assume to be danger, you have the ability to check yourself before your wreck yourself.

Try meditating together for 10 minutes and not shutting feelings out. Invite them for tea.

The groups **homework** is to keep meditating for two times a day. The "Invite Mara for Tea" method can be used in every meditation session where a feeling keeps coming back.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on emotional intelligence. Why is emotional intelligence important? Are there other ways to improve it? 

Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

A good question to ask the group is: do you feel like you *are* your thoughts? Do you decribe yourself as "being angry" or "having a feeling of anger"? It can make a huge difference. We can view emotions as weather. They come and go. We don't always need to identify with them.

As usual, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session.

Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- Another way to improve your emotional intelligence is writing a diary. Journaling forces you to express your emotions. Reading the diary will help you understand your own emotional themes.
- It’s usually helpful to recognize where in the body the feeling manifests itself. You could also ask the group what the feeling would be if it did not present itself in the body. Where and how would that be?
- This is an exercise in meta-ok-ness, meaning that things are OK even when they are not OK. Sadness is not OK ... but it’s OK. Meta-OK-ness is a very powerful tool both in meditation and in life in general.
