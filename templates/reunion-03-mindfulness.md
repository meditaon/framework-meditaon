# Session #3 - Meditation

In this session, participants will learn about mindfulness, why it's kind of a useless word, and how to get better at it.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on meditation homework. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-mindfulness): mindfulness. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-ways-to-practice-mindfulness): different ways to increase mindfulness. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings during the session. Also make sure to write down questions you didn't have the time to answer, and get back to them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. How has your experience of meditation been? Was it hard? Easy? Nice? Uncomfortable? Was it hard to find the time to do it? Did you notice anything different in stressful situations?

Make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection.

Note that mental training works like physical training. Results are related to input and effort. If the group has trouble finding the time to do their homework, try helping them out. Is it easier at home or at work? On the commute? During breaks? 

If the group works in the same building, perhaps they can set up a daily session in a conference room where they do the exercises together.

It's not your job to make them feel bad for not doing the homework. Point out how important it is and coach them to make it happen.

In this session, you will discuss how meditate in-action. A potential time-saver!

## 2. Teaching: mindfulness
Mindfulness is not a useful word anymore. After the last couple of years hype, it has morphed from being an almost sacred act of attention into being, like, whatever. Sometimes it's used interchangeably with presence.

So I encourage you to make up your own words. What you're looking for is a state where you are aware of yourself and your surroundings. Your thoughts and feelings, the sounds around you, the breath moving in and out through the nose. Just like you practiced in meditation.

I prefer the term "wakefulness" or "being awake." It stands as opposed to daydreaming, which many of us do all day. While we're in this meeting, we're thinking about the next. When we're at home, we think about work. When we're at work, we think about our family. When we watch a movie, we scroll through Facebook.

Most people agree that single-tasking is more productive than multi-tasking. But how often do we actually do it? And why is it so hard?

Mindfulness is, in a way, extreme single-tasking. Just walking, completely mindful. Or eating, without thinking about anything except the taste of the food. Actually not even thinking about the next slice of pizza before you've finished this one.

There are long and complicated books trying to define mindfulness. Exploring how different types of mindfulness can be used in different spiritual activites. In this course, we're just learning what it feels like to do one thing at a time and experiencing it fully. Perhaps mindfulness is not the right word to use - feel free to make up something else.

## 3. Method: ways to practice mindfulness
Meditation is, as far as I know, the best way to increase your mindfulness. Being aware of the breath is good training for being aware of your food and your actions.

But you could also do mindful eating. Have your meal and just have it. No phone, no talking. Eat it like it was a million-dollar meal.

You could do mindful walking.

You could to mindful yoga. 

Or washing the dishes mindfully.

If there is space enough in the room, try out mindful walking, or walking meditation. Be aware of every step. To be fully aware, you will naturally walk a bit slower. Perhaps even in slow-mo. Notice your thoughts, just as in meditation. And when you find yourself drifting in attention ...

If there is not enough space, you could try eating meditation by handing out raisings. Feel them, taste them, chew them and swallow them mindfully.

Or, you could just do meditation like last week, but calling it mindful breathing instead.

The **homework** for the coming week is to keep spending two times ten minutes a day on meditation. But it would be OK to switch one or both session for a mindful activity like eating or walking.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on the concept of mindfulness. How could it help with stress and focus? Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

Tell the group that you will stay afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session. Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- When you're doing meditation, try saying yes to everything. Say yes to restlessness. To thoughts drifting. To any pain that comes. Memories and anxiety. Try saying yes to everything and see what happens.
- Fall seven times, get back up eight. It's completely natural to be thinking about something else during meditation. It doesn't matter how many times it happens. Just keep at it. It's a meditation practice. 
- Try a body scan to become more aware of your body. Be mindful of your feet. Your legs. Your stomach. And so forth. Body scanning is a great way to start your meditation.
