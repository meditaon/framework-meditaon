# Session #6 - Culture

In this session, we will shift our focus from our own training to our organisation can maximize flow. And calm. And focus.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): thoughts on flow. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-company-culture): company culture. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-methods-to-increase-group-productivity): ideas on improving group productivity. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

Teacher: note goodies from the session in your notebook. Follow-up on them in an email after the session.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. What was your experience of having an hour of flow? Was it possible? Did you get more done? What distracted you? Did you notice any difference in stress levels?

As usual, make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection.

Ask the group to give each other advice. If someone wasn’t able to create time for flow, brainstorm ideas on how  you can solve the problem.

## 2. Teaching: company culture
There are many paradoxes surrounding meditation. One of them is that it’s a great self-help method but if you use it just to improve yourself, you’ll get stuck.

We need to look beyond ourselves.

So that’s what we’re looking at in this session. How can awareness improve our team, our division or our entire company?

For one thing, stress is contagious. Stress will not spread as fast if you've implemented stress management in your culture.

Many people who take this course talk about their managers being the source of stress. Are the managers aware of this? If not, how can we make them? Are you measuring well-being today?

Remember that meditation and mindfulness are not the best methods. First, make sure people are getting enough sleep and have the time and energy to do physical exercise. Most people don’t need more methods. They need to prioritize the methods they already have.

That could mean that they need to take a walk every day at work. Without their phones. Just walking.

## 3. Methods to increase group productivity

First off, you need to start measuring stress and well-being in the company. If you’re not doing that, you’ll have no idea what’s working and what’s not. I use [Thriver](http://www.thriver.io) in my courses but I’m biased towards it since I’m a part of the development team. Do whatever works for you - but start measuring.

Now, there are a million ways to go about this. A simple method to start could be to do 10 minutes of stress management every day at 2:30 PM. Pick your own method. Is it meditation? Walking? Listening to classical music? Drinking tea and looking out the window?

It could be starting out every meeting with a minute or so of silence. Just to calm the mind. Or take a breather in the middle of the meeting - but don’t check the phones. Just sit down and breathe. When you find that you don’t have the time for taking two minutes, you should do five minutes.

The most important part is spreading commitment and responsibility throughout the organisation. A burnout is not one single persons fault. We’re all responsible for helping each other to battle stress. If you see someone looking tired or having a hard time remembering things, ask them how they’re doing. 

The groups **homework** is to be a secret stress Santa. Pick someone at work which they will help optimize well-being and performance for. It could be by teaching them meditation, or bringing them out for a walk, or talking to them about their work. 

And of course - the best way to help others manage stress is to be calm yourself. The group should keep meditating for two times ten minutes every day.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on what culture. Do they have other ideas on how to manage stress effectively in the group? Perhaps you could start to measure the six causes of stress (see session #1).

Many participants appreciate the art of communication more after this course. For example, writing a long, thorough, formatted email will make the recipient less stressed. Include everything in the email. All contact information to others involved, documents referenced, links where they can find more information. Finish the email with clear action points and deadlines.

It sounds simple, but don't knock it until you've tried it. It takes more time, yes, but you're saving someone else time. And your future self.

Finish by thanking them for their time and attention. Let the group know you'll be staying afterwards as usual.

## Extra material
- It’s best to start small and measure. Make experiments for a couple of weeks and measure what happened. Compare to the invested time. There’s less friction implementing change this way. 
- If the group is up for it, you could try metta meditation. Ask the participants to meditate as usual to start with. Then ask them to wish themselves joy and picture themselves feeling happy. Ask them to do the same with every person in the room. Everyone in the company. As a grand finale,  wish someone challenging joy.
- Discuss why lowering stress could lead to increased productivity. For example, is it hard or easy to be creative in a stressful situation? Or to see things clearly? Sometimes there is a more elegant solution which has a high output and low input. But it’s often hidden from us in our myopic stress mindset.
