# Session #8 - Further training

In this final session, the group will discuss how to carry on their own training after the course ends and evaluate the course.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on well-being. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-what-happens-now): training after the course ends. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-a-final-meditation-session): final meditation session. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

You know the drill with taking notes by now :D

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. How did you experience writing gratitude lists? Did you try savoring any moments? Could you use it in your meditation practice?

Gratitude feels weird for many in the beginning. But just like the other exercises it’s results come from doing it over a long period of time. And most importantly: actually doing it. It’s not enought to think "uh, that's nice" for two seconds every now and then.

## 2. What happens now?
After this session, the course is over.

It’s been eight weeks which mirrors most of the science done on meditation. After eight weeks, you should be able to feel different in a lot of ways. But was it worth it? Perhaps there is some other activity that would give the same result.

Some participants want to explore the philosophical parts of meditation more. How does it relate to the idea of Self, when it’s obvious that I am not the one in charge of my thoughts. Or what’s this idea behind impermanence, where we notice that everything seems to come and go. Or perhaps even non-duality: that white necessitates black.

Others look at it from a self-help perspective. And others as a productivity tool. Help each person find their own strategy for moving forward with meditation. Recommend books, courses and techniques that suite their needs.

And remember to anchor your teachings to the group and the organisation. How can we spread a sense of calm and focus to the people around us?

It’s a good method to start every meditation session out with that question. It increases our motivation.

## 3. A final meditation session
Meditate together.

Answer any of the groups final questions.

## 4. Reflection
Let the group know that there will be an anonymous feedback form send out.

Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on the course. Was it a good investment of time? What did we learn? Has it affected work or even our private lives in any ways? Is there anything in the course that the teacher should update before teaching it again?

Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

The group should know the drill about your availability by now :)

Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- Tell the group what you’ve learned as a teacher. Retell any moments during the course that’s been especially interesting to you. Try to be as specific as possible. Now is a good time to mention if there is anything in particular you are grateful for.
- Remember that meditation is not special. It’s easy to become preachy once you’ve find something that works for you. But meditation is not the answer. For someone else, mountain biking is just as effective.
- Try to summarize the message of the course. Prioritize mental training and methods to increase calm and focus - because it will make the rest of your work so much better. 

When creativity and clarity is close at hand, we don’t need productivity hacks.
